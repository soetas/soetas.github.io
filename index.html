      <h1>Hello.</h1>
      <p>I'm Yaxing Son, an open source enthusiast, and a web developer.</p>
      <p>
        I first encountered programming, especially front-end technologies, during 
        my university years. The desire to share my work with others has been my main 
        motivation for staying passionate about web development. At the same time, 
        I truly enjoy the process of turning an idea into reality—it’s just so cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I write blog posts and occasionally stream programming content 
        on <a href="">Bilibili</a> and <a href="">YouTube</a>. Besides my professional work, I also contribute to open 
        source projects on <a href="">GitHub</a>. If you’ve benefited from my open source work, you can 
        support me financially through <a href="">GitHub Sponsors</a>. Of course, you’re also welcome to 
        follow me on <a href="">X</a> and <a href="">BlueSky</a>, where I sometimes share posts about tech products and trending 
        life topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond programming, I also enjoy design, photography, and pets. You can find 
        some of my photos on <a href="/photos.html">this page</a>. If we share similar interests, feel free to 
        reach out—let’s grab coffee or collaborate on something!
